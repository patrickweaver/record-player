  How do I use your Spotify and other data?

<p class="card" style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 1.5em;">
Spotify login is required for accessing the Spotify API. Apps can use login with Spotify and the Spotify API to do things like access your listening history, or manage your library. <strong>I do not do anything like this with your Spotify data.</strong> The only data collected by this site is a temporary log of the guesses that Google Vision makes. The images you upload are deleted after they are used to query the Google Vision API. You can view the <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/record-player" target="_blank">source code</a> of the app if you are curious about how it works.
